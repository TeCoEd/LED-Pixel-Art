# LED-Pixel-Art
A simple Python program that pulls out RGB values from a 10 x 10 pxel JPEG image and then writes them to an LED display.

I built a 10 x 10 LED board then used Python to display JPEGSs in real time.  The LEDs are GRB so the program code has to covert them into the 
correct RGB order first.
